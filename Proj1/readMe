what is the assignment doing:                                                                                                             
This project is implementing one of the most popular games of chance is a dice game known as "craps."

how to build your program: 
g++ main.cpp -o craps

how to use your program:                                                                                                                  
Just follow my program instructions.

any limitation, issues:  
1) even tho i check if you give a char as your wager, 
giving a string will print the error msg (x) the length of your string so it looks messy

cant find anything else
