Lab number :
Lab 4 project 2 (gameOfLife)

what its doing :
Implementing gameOfLife

how to build :
g++ main.cpp gameOfLife.cpp -o gol -lncurses

how to use :
you need to first click the screen to start, then just follow the instructions

limitations:
1) theres no way to leave during generations so once you pick a number you need to go through all of the generations or press stop
2) you can enter letters for the amount of generations u want it will show the starting generation in return
3) really hard to place live cells, since the screen is blank so placing what you want might take a bit
